# lein-docker

A Leiningen plugin to build and deploy [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/macluck/lein-docker.svg)](https://clojars.org/macluck/lein-docker)

## Usage

Available commands:

    $ lein docker build
    $ lein docker push
    $Â lein docker remove

## Configuration

You can add the following configuration options at the root of your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:docker {:image-name "myregistry.example.org/myimage"
         :dockerfile "target/dist/Dockerfile"
         :build-dir  "target"}
```

Defaults:

* `:image-name` is your project's name (without the group ID)
* `:dockerfile` points to `Dockerfile`
* `:build-dir` points to the project's root

## Releasing your docker images

You can use Leiningen to handle your technical release process. In order to do that with your Docker image instead of
your plain jar file, configure your release tasks similar to that:

```clojure
:release-tasks [["vcs" "assert-committed"]
                ["change" "version" "leiningen.release/bump-version" "release"]
                ["vcs" "commit"]
                ["vcs" "tag"]
                ["clean"]
                ["uberjar"]
                ["docker" "build"]
                ["docker" "push"]
                ["change" "version" "leiningen.release/bump-version"]
                ["vcs" "commit"]
                ["vcs" "push"]]
```
